# Install coreutils to get gls (GNU ls), which supports colorization from
# LS_COLORS (instead of bash's LSCOLORS).
#
# https://github.com/sharkdp/vivid#on-macos
#
# @todo old note
# Prepend gnubin to path to use gls and gdircolors instead of ls and
# dircolors. Unlike the macOS builtins, the GNU versions read and write to
# LS_COLORS instead of LSCOLORS. Most zsh plugins--including completion--use
# LS_COLORS, so this leads to more consistent output colorization.
